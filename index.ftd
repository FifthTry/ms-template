-- ds.page: Master Site Package

There are several essential components that are typically included in a master 
component set for websites. These components are the building blocks of web pages 
and help ensure consistency in design and functionality across a website. Some 
common components include:

- Header: This typically includes the website's logo, navigation menu, and search bar.

- Footer: This section is typically located at the bottom of the page and includes important links, copyright information, and other key details.

- Navigation: This component typically includes links to important pages on the website and may be located in the header or footer.

- Hero section: This is a large, prominent section at the top of the page that often includes a striking visual element and a call-to-action.

- Content sections: These sections typically make up the bulk of the page and may include text, images, videos, and other types of media.

- Call-to-action buttons: These are buttons that encourage users to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.

- Forms: These are important for collecting information from users, such as when they sign up for an account or make a purchase.

- Modal windows: These are pop-up windows that display important information or prompts, such as when a user is about to leave a page or when they need to confirm an action.

- Error messages: These are important for alerting users when something has gone wrong or when they need to provide additional information.

By incorporating these components into a master component set, website designers 
and developers can ensure that their website is consistent and easy to use, which 
can help improve user experience and increase engagement.
